            <h4>Coution!</h4>
            for first timers, it is adviced to start with <a href="#">HTML</a> before learning anythind else. I know that in higher institution you've
            always started with C programming and some python; it is not that bad, but I'd advice you to start with HTML. Here are some of the reasons why:
            <ul>
                <li> <i class="bi bi-link"></i> HTML is so easy to learn. it's just like learning abbreviations in English. for instance,
                     in HTML, <b>div</b> means <b>division</b></li>
                <li> <i class="bi bi-link"></i> This is the basic language used in web development. it is the skeleton for every website found on the internet.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="needs">
            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>What is HTML?</p>
            HTML, as I've stated above, is basically the skeleton for any website. When you open any website on Chrome, it is HTML that displays the content there.
            it is usually made up of words, sentences, buttons, links, lists and so on. Simply, whatever you see apart from colors on a website, is HTML. <br><br>
            <h5><b>Elements of HTML</b></h5>
            <p>HTML is divided into so many elements. These elements are used to add properties such as paragraphes and links.</p>
